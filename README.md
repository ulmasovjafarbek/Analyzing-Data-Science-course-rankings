# Analyzing-Data-Science-course-rankings

## Description

In this exploratory data analysis notebook, I analyzed the rankings of Data Science and Data Analysis courses. Objectives of this study is to find out what are the best DS courses, using MOOCs ranking platform, Classcentral.

The study is carried out in two stages: Data Science courses and Data Analysis courses. The main Python libraries used in this notebook are Beautiful Soup for scraping data from Classcentral, Pandas for forming dataframes, and Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn for visualizing the data.

The results show that edX and Coursera are the most popular Data Science and Data Analytics course providers, while MIT and Johns Hopkins University are the highest ranked institutes who produce these courses.

NOTE: Since the study is limited to data from Classcentral platform, it can be improved substantially by taking a more qualitative approach and by taking a closer look at individual courses inside their respective provider platforms. For instance, on Coursera IBM's Data Science and Google's Data Analytics are among the highest ranked courses, and each has thousands of reviews. In Classcentral, however, these courses have not yet received enough number of reviews, and thus are not present in the results section.
